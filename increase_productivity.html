									Was going through an article which discussed measures to increase productivity at workplace.
									<br>
									Here's a summary for you all :
									<ul >
										<li>
											Create smaller pull requests. Never leave a day's work without checking it in.
										</li>
										<li>
											Never check-in code that does not compile or breaks the build.
										</li>
										<li>
											Have a clear understanding of the feature before you start to implement it. Ask as many questions as you want to have a clear idea of the requirement.
										</li>
										<li>
											Keep your code simple and well structured. Your teammates should be able to read the code and understand the intended use of it.
										</li>
										<li>
											Focus on shipping small. Break your assignments into smaller logical chunks. Get it clarified and then deliver the smallest possible block of working functionality as requested.
										</li>
										<li>
											Keep a positive attitude towards every feedback.
										</li>
										<li>
											Limit your personal tasks during office hours to a bare minimum. You can always take permission from the manager if you have to take a couple of hours off to attend to unavoidable personal issues.
										</li>
										<li>
											Spend your time and effort to learn technologies that you can actually use to implement something in your workplace.
										</li>
										<li>
											Use the learnings. You will learn more from implementing something on your own than following any tutorial.

										</li>
									</ul>
