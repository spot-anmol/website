									Would you also like to have the following features in these chat apps?
									<br>
									Take a look.
									<ul >
										<li>
											1- Lock a specific Group : Though there are fingerprint or face locks on the whole app now, a group specific pin lock facility would be fantastic. For instance locking an all guys/girls group.
										</li>
										<li>
											2- Maintain the order : When I send a few messages to one person and then want to forward the same to someone else, as soon as I select all the messages and forward them, the order gets jumbled. Having the same order when forwarded would save quite some time of the users.
										</li>
										<li>
											3- Reordering photos : After selecting multiple photos to send, reordering them becomes a problem. One has to switch between app and gallery to set the correct order. The same can be easily done inside the app only.
										</li>
										<li>	
											4- Where is the text : After sending a photo and writing some text with it, if I forward that message to someone else, only the photo gets forwarded and not the text. Would be great if both get forwarded the same time.
										</li>
									</ul>
									
								</p>
								<p>
									Just a few observations, I believe if turned to features would make lives easier for a lot of users.
